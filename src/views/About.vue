    <h1>Why Pocket Lite?</h1>
    <p>
      I made Pocket Lite because I realize that I was only using it a list of
      links. I almost never use the Pocket Reader and instead open the link in
      new tab for reading on the real website.

      I also use Pocket at work, where Twitter is blocked. This means that
      articles saved directly from Twitter with the Pocket integration can't be
      opened by clicking on the subtitle link.
